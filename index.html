    <p>I haven't learned <span class="hotmail">HTML</span> before, so this is going to be my first shot at this.
      <em>Just putting that out there.</em>

        <h2>Today's topic: <i><span class="hotmail">HTML</span></i></h2>
        HTML is a hot new tool that the whole industry just started using! Users include:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Successful software developers</b> who, through a combination of luck, determination, and by god the
            most unholy amount of gumption, managed to break into the industry.
          </li>
          <li><b>Middle school children</b> who's teachers, for one hour, put them on CodeAcademy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And that's the complete list.</p>

        <h3>What exactly does HTML stand for?</h3>
        <p>Many people, even some very well studied people, have somehow come to the conclusion
          that HTML stands for <strong>"Hypertext Markup Language"</strong>, and think that is what websites are made
          of.</p>

        <p>These people don't know what they're talking about.</p>

          <img src="https://www.poynter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HOTMAIL.png" height=100 alt="Hotmail logo">

        <section>
          <p>HTML is actually short for <b><i>Hotmail</i></b>, which started off as a digital mailing service ran on
            some poorly ventilated computers,
            hence the name. People would send eachother digital mail, which we now call "digi-Letters", which would
            sometimes
            contain websites. Ever since people stopped using Hotmail, HTML has been used to refer to the inner workings
            of a website.</p>

          <aside>
            <p>However, much like the water that runs through our rivers, the earth beneath our feat, and the air that
              we breathe, no one really knows what websites are made of.
            </p>
          </aside>

          <p>And another thing that bothers me; Hypertext Markup <i>"Language"?</i> To remind those of us at home, a
            language is something
            that you speak. With your mouth. We'll let go of the fact that the first two words are complete gibberish,
            but as far as I'm aware, nobody speaks "Hypertext Markup" to their friends. I think you'd find yourself out
            of luck if you tried to
            find me a country where it is common
            for one person to say to the other, <code>"&#60p&#62 Hey, fine weather we're having! &#60\p&#62"</code></p>

        <h3>How do you know so much about HTML, Jakob?</h3>

        <p>
          Pure gumption, that's how. Also, look at what I can do.
