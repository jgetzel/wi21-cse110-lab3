## Jakob Getzel Standup Notes

#### What did you do yesterday?
- Last lab, I worked on making an HTML website with serveral tag requirements.
#### What will you do today?
- Today, I will add CSS to that same site in order to figure my way around CSS
#### Where are you blocked?
- I didn't know anything about CSS or where to start.
#### Comfort Level â€” How close are we to hitting our sprint goals?
- I think that I have a high probability of finishing this lab by tonight.
